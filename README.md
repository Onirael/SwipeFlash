# Swipe Flash

Swipe Flash is a flashcard app whose goal is to transform raw lists of learning material into a a satisfying and learning experience. The application has a simplified UI which creates a smooth user experience.

In order to learn a vocabulary list, the user simply has to swipe each card left or right depending on whether the card was guessed correctly. The application will use a Leitner system combined with a forgetting curve handling to make sure the flashcards are learned in the best way possible.

To improve the quality of the learning, a daily revision is recommended.

# Managing flashcards

Flashcards are divided into families, e.g. "English to Spanish" or "Capitals of the world". These families can be found by going to settings -> Manage Flashcards... where they can be edited, enabled/disabled or removed entirely.

Families all have two categories (one for each side of the cards), these categories (e.g. "Spanish" or "English") all have a logo which is displayed on the top right corner of the card's opposite side to indicate what category the expected answer falls into. This logo must be unicode (emoji) to be accepted. Microsoft's emojis are currently limited, therefore some logos might not be displayed correctly.
